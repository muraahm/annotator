# annotator

- run the server and got to "http://localhost:8001/"
- upload image
- select interesting or uninteresting for the annotation you wanna create
- after you are done click on JSON Output and you can check the browser console or
  theterminal for the required JSON
- click and upload a new image to start over

I want to add more styling and refactor the code but I'm traveling as I was hoping to do the second test but unfortunately I can't at the moment
